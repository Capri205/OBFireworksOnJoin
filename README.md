# OBFireworksOnJoin

Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin to release fireworks from the players location when they join a server/world.

No commands. Just put it into the plugins folder and enjoy.

The compiled jar file is also in the target folder of the repo so can be downloaded directly from there. This is also the complete Eclipse project so it should import into Eclipse (I was using Oxygen.3.a Release 4.7.3a).

Compiled for 1.17, but should work with older versions (up to a point).
